# Implementation Plan for Heady Lab Results

This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan for the Heady Lab Results web platform. The focus is on secure development, resilient architecture, and efficient integration of required functionalities. The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of the steps and considerations.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Initial Configuration

- **Repository & Environment Setup:**
  - Clone the CodeGuide Starter Pro repository (`https://github.com/codeGuide-dev/codeguide-starter-pro`) as the project base.
  - Configure the environment using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn UI.
  - Set up Supabase for database, authentication, and storage services.
  - Integrate version control best practices and secure default configurations.

- **Security by Design:**
  - Enforce least privilege and secure all API endpoints by default.
  - Configure environment variables and secrets management (e.g., Supabase keys, Stripe API keys) with a dedicated secrets management tool.
  - Establish logging and error handling frameworks that avoid information leakage.

---

## 2. User Authentication & Roles

- **Authentication Setup:**
  - Integrate Supabase Authentication ensuring robust user identification.
  - Use strong password policies (minimum length, complexity) along with secure hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
  - Configure secure session management: enforce http-only cookies, short-lived tokens, and CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.
  - Validate and sanitize all authentication inputs.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Define two roles: administrators and regular retailers.
  - Enforce strict authorization on endpoints: administrative functions (user management, system settings) must be restricted to admins only.
  - Verify permissions for every sensitive operation server-side.

---

## 3. PDF Upload & Processing Workflow

- **File Upload & Validation:**
  - Implement a secure file upload mechanism using Supabase storage.
  - Validate file type (PDF only), enforce file size (< 1MB), and restrict number of pages (<= 5).
  - Sanitize and validate file metadata to prevent injection and path traversal attacks.

- **Asynchronous Processing Queue:**
  - Integrate an asynchronous job queue (e.g., using Bull or Supabase functions) to handle PDF processing.
  - Ensure that the queue is isolated with minimal privileges to only process files after validating them securely.
  - Provide status updates to users through secure API endpoints.

- **AI Integration (GPT-4o):**
  - Integrate the GPT-4o API for generating product descriptions from lab results.
  - Secure the API integration by validating the inputs passed to GPT-4o and sanitizing the outputs.
  - Monitor API usage to protect against rate limiting and potential abuse.

---

## 4. Subscription Management & Payment Integration

- **Stripe Integration:**
  - Set up Stripe for subscription management with tiered plans (Basic, Enterprise) and a 7-day free trial.
  - Implement secure webhook endpoints to handle payment events (successful payment, retries on failure, and plan downgrades).
  - Enforce proper authentication to ensure that Stripe webhooks are only accepted from trusted sources.

- **Failed Payments & Retry Logic:**
  - Develop a retry mechanism (up to 3 retries) for failed payments.
  - Automatically downgrade users to a free plan if all payment attempts fail.
  - Notify users via email about payment status changes and reminders.

---

## 5. Reporting & Notifications

- **Reporting:**
  - Implement a secure CSV export feature for lab analysis data and activity logs.
  - Ensure that data export is only accessible to authorized users.
  - Sanitize all inputs/outputs to prevent injection attacks.

- **Email Notifications:**
  - Integrate an email service (using a provider like SendGrid or similar).
  - Automate low-credit alerts and subscription reminders, ensuring validated email content and addresses.
  - Avoid exposing sensitive data in email content, and securely manage email templates.

---

## 6. Frontend UI & User Experience

- **Modern Minimalistic Design:**
  - Utilize Next.js with the app router for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
  - Implement the UI using shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.
  - Ensure client-side data is handled securely; avoid storing sensitive information in localStorage or sessionStorage.

- **User Journey Flow:**
  - **Onboarding:** Secure user registration/login with 7-day free trial subscription selection.
  - **Dashboard:** Role-based dashboards: administrators access system settings and user management, while retailers access lab result histories and current subscriptions.
  - **PDF Upload & Feedback:** Clear prompts for PDF uploading with immediate validation feedback and asynchronous processing status updates.
  - **Results & Reporting:** Display AI-generated product descriptions and provide accessible CSV download functionality.

---

## 7. Infrastructure & DevOps Considerations

- **Deployment Environment:**
  - Deploy on a hardened server environment with only necessary ports open, applying firewall rules and monitoring logs.
  - Use HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) across the entire application to protect data in transit.

- **CI/CD & Automated Testing:**
  - Set up a CI/CD pipeline with automated testing for API endpoints, file uploads, and UI components.
  - Include security scanning (SCA, dependency checks) and static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.
  - Disable debugging and verbose error logs in the production environment.

- **Dependency & Code Management:**
  - Use lockfiles (e.g., package-lock.json) to maintain a secure dependency graph.
  - Regularly monitor and update third-party libraries.

---

## 8. Final Review & Security Auditing

- **Pre-launch Security Audit:**
  - Perform a thorough security review of the entire system, focusing on authentication, file processing, API integrations, and data handling.
  - Run penetration testing and vulnerability scans (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Snyk) before production deployment.
  - Ensure that detailed logging is in place for auditing purposes without exposing sensitive information in logs.

- **Post-Launch Monitoring:**
  - Implement continuous monitoring for security incidents and performance issues.
  - Set up alerts for unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity.

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan and adhering strictly to secure coding best practices and principles, the Heady Lab Results platform will be designed to be secure, resilient, and user-friendly. This approach ensures that all critical components—from user authentication to asynchronous PDF processing—are thoroughly validated, authorized, and monitored for security vulnerabilities.
